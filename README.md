# Servio

A pure python file server with no dependencies. Don't use this in production :)

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install servio
```

## Usage

```bash
$ servio [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

Where `PATH` is the relative or absolute path to the directory intended for serving. If not given, `servio` will serve the current directory.
